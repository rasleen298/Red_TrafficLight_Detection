# Red_TrafficLight_Detection
Detection of Red Traffic Light in real-time video feeds using OpenCV.

## Technologies Used :
OpenCV
Python 
NumPy

I have devised an algorithm that detects the red traffic light in the video feed. It can be modified for real-time feed as well. The algorithm uses HSV variations of the color and techniques including hough circle transform, color detection, and object tracking, and detects the lights in real-time.
The parameters can be modified further for better accuracy.

The dataset videos are provided by Synergy Labs for the task completion.
## Instructions
```
The Github repository contains the Python script - ​detection.py
 Just clone the repository and run the file.
 The outputs videos on the dataset provided are under the​ outputs folder.
```
